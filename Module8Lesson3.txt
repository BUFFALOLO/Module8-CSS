MODULE 8 - LESSON 3 - CSS BOX MODEL & LAYOUT
How we position elements is similar to setting up camp.

Static: The default setting. It sits according to the natural flow of the page, unmoved by positioning commands.
Relative: It allows you to move your tent relative to where it would normally stand. It's still part of the campsite layout but with a personal twist.
Absolute: It positions itself in relation to the nearest positioned ancestor (not static). Your element can float in a precise spot, ignoring the traditional flow of the document.
Fixed: It stays in the exact same spot in the viewport, no matter how far you scroll down the path.
Sticky: A mix of static & fixed, like a tent that's on the ground until you start moving, then it sticks to the top of your view as you explore further. It toggles between relative & fixed based on the user's scroll position.

The display property dictates how items are displayed. It's like deciding whether to set up a tent, a lean-to, or just sleep under the stars.
Block: Block elements are like tents that demand their own space. They take up the full width available, stacking vertically.
Inline: Sociable, aligning side by side, think of sleeping bags.
Inline-Block: A blend, like a bivvy bag, aligns but respects padding & margins.
None: Opts out, making the element invisible & removing it from the document flow.

FLOATS & CLEARING FLOATS
Floats are like canoes on a river, allowing elements to drift left or right, letting content flow around them. It's handy for wrapping text around images or creating layouts.
But, beware of the rapids! Without clearing floats, your layout can capsize, with elements overflowing their containers.
Clearing floats brings everything back in line, ensuring the content below the float respects its boundaries.

Z-index: determines who's on top of the mountain & who's nestled in the valley, allowing for intricate layering & interaction in your design.
Overflow: lets you control how to handle this excess whether to clip it, add scroll bars or let it spill out.
